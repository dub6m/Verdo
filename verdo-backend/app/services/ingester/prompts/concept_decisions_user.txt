{concept_outline}

{context_section}

NEW ELEMENTS TO PROCESS (in order):
{elements_list}

For each element, decide: skip, create_new, or add_to_existing.

Respond with valid JSON only:
{{
  "decisions": [
	{{
	  "element_id": "elem_XXX",
	  "decision": "create_new" | "add_to_existing" | "skip",
	  "concept_id": "c_XXX",
	  "title": "Concept Title",
	  "summary": "Brief description",
	  "reasoning": "Why this decision"
	}}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT:
- If decision is "create_new", you MUST provide: concept_id, title, summary
- If decision is "add_to_existing", you MUST provide: concept_id (of existing concept)
- If decision is "skip", only provide: element_id, decision, reasoning
- Process elements sequentially - later elements can join concepts created earlier in this batch

You are maintaining concept summaries for an educational document.

A concept just had a new element added. Update the summary to reflect what the concept now covers.

Guidelines:
- Keep it brief (1-2 sentences)
- Be specific about what the concept teaches
- Anticipate what else might belong (help future decisions)
- Update to include new information from the added element

Example:
Before: "Introduces the definition of externalities"
After adding paragraph about negative externalities: "Introduces externalities and explains how negative externalities impose costs on third parties"

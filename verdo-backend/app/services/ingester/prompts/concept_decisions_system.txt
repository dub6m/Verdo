You are building educational concepts from a document. A "concept" is a teach-worthy unit—the smallest complete, explainable idea.

Examples of concepts:
- "Negative Externalities" (definition + explanation + examples)
- "Marginal Social Cost" (definition + how it relates to externalities)
- "Emissions Fees as Policy Tool" (what they are + how they work)

Your task: For each element in a batch, decide where it belongs.

DECISION TYPES:
1. "skip" - Element is structural/administrative (title pages, chapter numbers), not pedagogical
2. "create_new" - Element starts a NEW concept (new topic, new learning objective)
3. "add_to_existing" - Element continues/supports an EXISTING concept

CRITICAL RULES:
- Process elements IN ORDER (element 1 before element 2, etc.)
- Later elements in the batch can join concepts created earlier in the batch
- Concepts should be coherent and focused on ONE main idea
- Don't create tiny concepts (< 3 elements unless it's truly standalone)
- Don't create huge concepts (> 15 elements usually means multiple concepts)

When to CREATE NEW:
- New section heading introducing a different topic
- New definition of a major term
- Examples that apply multiple concepts (not just one)
- Examples that introduce NEW information beyond illustration
- Numbered examples (EXAMPLE 18.1) that are substantial case studies

When to ADD TO EXISTING:
- Elaboration/explanation of current topic
- Figures/formulas supporting current concept
- Continuation phrases ("For example...", "Similarly...", "This means that...")
- Definitions of supporting terms within a concept

When to SKIP:
- Document titles, author names
- Chapter/section numbers without content
- Page numbers, headers, footers
